# Ploskiy Vision

You control a character who can only move in screen space (the camera does not follow him). You can also rotate the world around the character to get to previously inaccessible places.  

Collect all the white circles on the level and then you will open the exit from the level. Beware of lava (red tiles) and going off the screen

## Controls
* <kbd>←</kbd>, <kbd>→</kbd> movement
* <kbd>↑</kbd> jump
